Helloooooo. This is a face detection app. Insert an image url and the app will detect a human face if it's present.
Highlights: Single-page application! Front-end: react.js (data transfer between components via states), change in state causes the app to render different components, api-calls using 'fetch', AJAX, input filtering, connection to back-end
